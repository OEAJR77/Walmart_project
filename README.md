PROBLEM STATEMENT 

A retail company with multiple outlets across the country is facing significant challenges in managing its inventory efficiently. The primary issue is the misalignment between supply and demand, which leads to either stockouts or overstocking. This mismanagement not only affects sales but also results in unnecessary operational costs and customer dissatisfaction. As a data scientist, the goal is to analyze the available sales data and create predictive models that can accurately forecast sales for a specified number of months or years, helping the stores maintain an optimal inventory level and reduce the mismatch between supply and demand.

The dataset provided contains key variables such as weekly sales data, store-specific information, holiday flags, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, and unemployment rates. The objective is to leverage this data to derive useful insights and create models that can predict sales trends, taking into account both historical data and external factors like seasonality, holidays, economic conditions, and weather.
